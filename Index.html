                respect for human dignity, and transparency. </li>
    
    
    <li><b>Competence</b> - Consider the candidate's educational </br>background and record of 
                service. Do not base against popularity or name recall.</li>
    
    
    <li><b>Compassion</b> - Assess whether the candidate shows genuine  </br>concern for marginalized 
                 sectors and promotes social justice and empowerment.</li>
    
   
    <li><b>Companion</b> - Analyze the reputation of the candidate's  </br>partylist and advisers. 
                They might be associated with political dynasties.</li>
    
   
    <li><b>Commitment</b> - The candidate should be dedicated to his </br> principles and stance that 
                promote the common good.</li>

  <h3>Avoid Misinformation</h3>
  <p>To avoid misinformation, it is important knowing how to spot them.
  </br>
  Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.
  
  </br>
  Look closely at the link. A phony or look-alike link may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the link. You can go to the site to compare the link to established sources.
  
  </br>
  Investigate the source. Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their "About" section to learn more.
  
  </br>
  Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from.
  
  </br>
  Inspect the dates. False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered. Check the evidence. Check the author's sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story.
  
  </br>
  Look at other reports. If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it's more likely to be true.
  
  </br>
  Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story's details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.
  
  </br>
  Some stories are intentionally false. Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible.

    <h3>Encouragement for Fellow Citizens to Vote Wisely</h3>
    <p>As responsible citizens, it's crucial that we exercise our right to vote wisely, 
      as it's a powerful tool that shapes the future of our nation. By casting our ballots, 
      we're not only choosing our leaders but also influencing the policies that impact our daily 
       lives. Every single vote counts, and history has shown that even a handful of votes can decide the
       outcome of an election. Therefore, it's essential that we educate ourselves about the candidates, their 
       manifestos, and the issues at stake, and then make informed decisions. Let's encourage our fellow citizens 
       to rise to the challenge and vote wisely, as it's our collective responsibility to shape the destiny of our 
       nation.</p>
